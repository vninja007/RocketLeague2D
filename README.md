# Rocket League 2D

Vrishak's attempt at a popular consumer game, replicated in 2D through microcontrollers and TFTs.

# Usage

Code is available at `code`. Working code (and essentially final code) is available at `code/working`.

This program is compiled and meant to be for NodeMCU-32S, a variant of the ESP32 board. Graphics are optimized through [TFT eSPI](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI).
