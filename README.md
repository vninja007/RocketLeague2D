# Rocket League 2D

Vrishak's attempt at a popular consumer game, replicated in 2D through microcontrollers and TFTs. This is a quarter 3 project for Robotics 2 finished in ~3 weeks.

This game relicates a very minimalistic version of turning, moving, ball collisions, friction, and wall collisions. Single player for now, will be multiplayer soon.

# Usage

Code is available at `code`. Working code (and essentially final code) is available at `code/working`.

This program is compiled and meant to be for NodeMCU-32S, a variant of the ESP32 board. Graphics are optimized through [TFT eSPI](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI). 

Code and all finished by approximately 2024-03-21, fancy documentation completed 2024-04-09.
